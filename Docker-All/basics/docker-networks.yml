|  Docker Networks         |
---------------------------


When we install docker it creates three networks automatically
1) Bridge
2) none
3) host

.Bridge is the default netowrk a container gets attached to
    .docker run ubuntu

.Bridge network is a private internal network created by docker on the host, containers can access each other if required(to access from  outside world , port mapping is required)

.to associate a container to other network we use the --network option

    docker run ubuntu --network=none
    docker run ubuntu --network=host

.By specifiying --network=host , we are taking any network isolation between host and container

.With none network container is not accessible to internal or other network or any other containers



------User Defined Netowrk---------
-------------------------------------

We can create our own internal bridge network,

docker network create \
    --driver bridge \
    --subnet 182.18.0.0\16
    custom-isolated-network-name
    
    
docker network ls  --> to list all networks

.to see network settings use inspect command

    docker inspect container-name/id
    
    
.Docker has EMBEDDED DNS 
.All containers within docker host can resolve each other with the name of the container
.Built in DNS server runs at 127.0.0.11
