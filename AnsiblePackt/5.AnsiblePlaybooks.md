## Basic Skeleton of playbook

    ---
    # YAML documents begin with the document separator ---

    # The minus in YAML this indicates a list item.  The playbook contains a list
    # of plays, with each play being a dictionary
    -

    # Target: where our play will run and options it will run with

    # Variable: variables that will apply to the play, on all target systems

    # Task: the list of tasks that will be executed within the play, this section
    # can also be used for pre and post tasks

    # Handlers: handlers that are executed as a notify key from a task

    # Roles: list of roles to be imported into the play

    # Three dots indicate the end of a YAML document
    ...

> The playbook contains a list of plays, with each play being a dictionary
