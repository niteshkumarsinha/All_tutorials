# TOPICS 

- Using includes and imports
   * include tasks
   * include playbooks
   * include_tasks
   * import_playbook
   * import_tasks
   * differene between static and dynamic include/import approaches
   * Recommendations for choosing an approach

- Using tags (take advantage of playbook reuse through the execution of specific tasks)
- Using roles


## 1. Includes

> used for bundling tasks and even playbooks into separate files
> installing a lot of package can go into separate playbook that you can include in your main playbook

> cat include_playbook.yml
---
# YAML documents begin with the document separator ---

# The minus in YAML this indicates a list item.  The playbook contains a list
# of plays, with each play being a dictionary
-

  # Target: where our play will run and options it will run with
  hosts: all

  # Task: the list of tasks that will be executed within the play, this section
  # can also be used for pre and post tasks
  tasks:

     - name: Play 1 - Task 1
       debug:
         msg: Play 1 - Task 1

     - include: play1_task2.yml

# Three dots indicate the end of a YAML document

Note: 
  - There is however underlying differences which are worth being aware of.
  - Ansible has different mode of operation when using import and include known as static and dynamic
  - All imports are static and are processed during playbook parsing, includes which as we saw by the message, now deprecated on the other hand may be static or dynamic and this may vary depending on the version of ansible, newer include_* options are dynamic
