# TOPICS

- Facts
- The setup module and how this relates to fact gathering
- Filtering for specific facts
- The creation of specific facts
- How custom facts can be used in environments without super user access

> The Setup module is automatically run by default with every playbook execution in the gathering of facts in the target system

> Pulling network information
ansible centos1 -m setup -a 'gather_subset=network' | more

> To exclude minimum facts
ansible centos1 -m setup -a 'gather_subset=network,!all,!min' | more

> Preferred approach is to use filter option
ansible centos1 -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_memfree_mb'
ansible centos1 -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_mem*'

> When the playbook executes the gathering of facts through the setup module, we can see the root of this is `ansible_facts` keyword and when a module(not just setup) returns a dictionary called `ansible_facts` , ansible will add those variables to the scope of the guest that is running that module

> Putting it in an another way, everything under ansible_facts will automatically go into the root of the variable namespace for that host

> There is no `ansible_facts` key in the playbook context but all of the contexts underneath this is available

## CUSTOM FACTS

> Although ansible provides a lot of useful information, we may require facts from hosts that are not provided by `setup` module

> Ansible has a great feature for this known as custom facts allowing us to create our own facts that will be gathered as part of gather_facts process

> can be written in any language

> Returns a JSON structure 

> Returns an INI structure 

By default ansible expects custom facts to be placed in `/etc/ansible/facts.d` which is fine if you have root access, but is less desirable if you are not running as a root user or prefer to keep your configuration out of root context.

> cat getdate1.fact (JSON format)
#!/bin/bash
echo {\""date\"" : \""`date`\""}

> cat ./getdate2.fact (INI format)
#!/bin/bash
echo [date]
echo date=`date`

Note : INI format also has a category at the top

------------------------------

mkdir -p /etc/ansible/facts.d
sudo cp getdate1.fact /etc/ansible/facts.d
sudo cp getdate2.fact /etc/ansible/facts.d

Checking custom facts
> ansible ubuntu-c -m setup | tee X
> ansible ubuntu-c -m setup -a 'filter=ansible_local'
